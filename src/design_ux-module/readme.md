# Theoretical Social Media App Description:

You are tasked with designing a social media app where users can share photos, videos, and text-based posts, connect with friends, and discover content. The app features a personalized feed that displays posts from the userâ€™s friends and followed accounts. Users can interact with posts by liking, commenting, and sharing them. The app also includes profile pages where users can view and edit their personal information, manage their posts, and customize their privacy settings.

## Lab

### Scenary 1

#### Problem

The home screen of the app displays a cluttered interface with overwhelming information, making it difficult for users to focus on their fitness goals.

#### Solution

The important thing is first to carry out an in-depth investigation of what options serve users that are expendable, necessary and vital, the second is to separate responsibilities, if there are options that have nothing to do with the main feed, delete it, for example, that is not related to the publications of my friends, the people I follow or relevant news, putting into practice the principle of User-Centered Design, Consistency and Simplicity.

### Scenary 2

#### Problem

The navigation structure lacks clarity.

#### Solution

Improving navigation through icons, images and without so much text would help make the flow more optimized. It is important that the research previously carried out there are user records about their biggest complaints about any flow. Analyzing this information provided would enter the principle of Feedback and Response.
It is also important to add accessibility for people with disabilities, referring to the Accessibility principle.

### Scenary 3

#### Problem

The interaction design for tracking activities is not intuitive.

#### Solution

It is important to trace the most common interaction design problems to track physical activities through the user, either with individual or group interviews, surveys or any other means of receiving feedback, here I would enter the Research methods with Surveys and Questionnaires, Interviews and Usability Testing, and the Feedback and Response principle. Already applying the research, analysis and ideation, the implementation that goes hand in hand with the developer would enter, and would apply the User-Centered Design principle if the results were satisfactory.
